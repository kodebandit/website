A portfolio website I made for an assignment, because apparently I couldn't just let myself use Wix or Google Sites and give myself a break.

Currently looks like garbage on mobile.
Side navigation and top navigation are linked.
You can click where the top-navigation placeholder text is, type in a word describing another section, and go there.

PLANS/IDEAS
######################################
Implementation timelines TBD
    >> Modify top-nav
      >> Improve UX (readability of the elements themselves, suggestions/fill in on tab)
    >> Improve the "works" carousel with proper imagery, descriptions, and sort the full-height button situation out so the caption background doesn't look like hot trash
    >> whatever else comes to mind... probably something ridiculous that will break my existence

Hi. I made this website using some Bootstrap templating, my passion for Linux, at least 36 hours of raw coding, and some back-and-forth with Google Gemini to refine some structural ideas and merging JavaScript files.

I'm pretty sure the last time I worked with Bootstrap was 2016, and things have changed a lot since then... my comfort level is near-zero, and I realize I'm _very_ uninformed on their 9 years of improvements.

This was the first project I completed using any form of AI for assistance, and the process helped me understand the benefits of the tools available.
Howevwer, I spent hours working with Gemini to address specific syntax issues, suggesting more streamlined alternatives to what it offered me, and overall making sure the code actually functioned. Easily said, the tool would have been far less useful without prior knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript (though I have much more to refresh on with JS...)
